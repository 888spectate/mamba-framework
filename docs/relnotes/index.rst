Release Notes for Mamba ${version}
==================================

..
   Any new feature or bugfix should be listed in this file, for trivial fixes
    or features a bulleted list item is enough but for more sphisticated
    additions a subsection for their own is required.

Those are the release notes for Mamba ${version} released on ${release_date}.

Features
--------

* Added Created (201 HTTP) Response to predefined responses
* Added Unknown (209 HTTP) Response to predefined responses (209 is unassigned)
* Added Unauthorized (401 HTTP) Response to predefined responses
* Added MovedPermanently (301 HTTP) Response to predefined responses
* Added SeeOther (303 HTTP) Response to predefined responses
* Added decimal size and precission using size property for MySQL decimal fields definitions::

    some_field = Decimal(size=(10, 2))  # using a tuple
    some_field = Decimal(size=[10, 2])  # using a list
    some_field = Decimal(size=10.2)     # using a float
    some_field = Decimal(size='10,2')   # using a string
    some_field = Decimal(size=10)       # using an int (precission is set to 2)
* If user define `development` as `true` in the `application.json` config file, the twistd server will be started in **no** daemon mode, logging will be printed to standard output and no log file should be produced at all. If the user press Ctrl+C the mamba application will terminate immediately, this mode is quite useful to development stages
* We redirect all the regular twistd process logging messages to `syslog` if we don't define development mode as `true` in the application.json config file
* Added `package` subcommand to `mamba-admin` command line tool that allow us to pack, install and uninstall mamba based applications in order to reuse them (that doesn't replace setuptools and is not the way meant to package a full mamba application in order to distribute it, this is only meant to reuse code already present in other projects)
* Added shared controllers, models and views for mamba installed packages. We can now add a configuration file `installed_packages.json` with the following syntax so mamba can install and reuse scrips (JavaScript, CSS) controllers, models and views in automatic way (nota that views search paths are always added to Jinja2 templating search path even if `autoimport` is `false`)::


        {
            "packages": {
                "package_name": {
                    "autoimport": true,
                    "use_scripts": true
                }
            }
        }
* Added `restart` command to `mamba-admin` command line tool
* Added `checkers` package to `mamba.utils` for common checks on forms and applications

Bug Fixes
---------

* We were not using properly ZStorm/transaction and Twisted Transactor integration in Storm, now is fixed and a new `copy` helper method has been added to :class:`mamba.application.model.Model` class to allow simple object copy on user code because we can't use a store that has been created in a thread into the :class:`twisted.python.threadpool.ThreadPool` using the `@transact` decorator. If you need to pass initialized Storm objects directly to a view for whatever reasson you shouldn't use the `@transact` decorator at all (so you shouldn't use asynchronous call to the database for that).
* Now unhandled errors in Deferreds on routing module are displayed nicely in the logs file
* Model read method now returns a copy of the Storm object that can be used in other threads if the optional parameter copy is True (it's False by default)
* Fixed a bug in create SQL mamba-admin command when used with live (-l) option
* Fixed a bug related with PyPy and it's lack of **set_debug** method in **gc** object
* Now mamba-admin start and stop subcommands can be used inside valid mamba application directories only
* Adding dependency to fabric package as docs will not build without it
* Added mandatory option parameter `development` to the application.json template.
* Fixed memory leak in the routing system cache
* Fixed bug that hides log_file being null in options
* Fixed bug in package pack when using alternative names
* Fixed bug in package pack when version string has more than two levels
* Fixed bug related with routed methods that does not return anything
* Now mamba does not print a bogus and unrelated error message when there is some problem with the JSON config files
* Fixes paths in scrips and stylesheets that were preventing those ones to be added into the HTML generated by the templating engine
* :class:`~mamba.utils.Converter` wasn't serializing properties that were other objects properly, now is fixed
* decimal.Decimal values are now corretly serialized on :class:`~mamba.utils.Converter`


Changes
-------

* Now we can add a custom Jinja2 templates loader to our controller templates in two different ways:

    * **Method One**: Just pass the named param `loader=<your customer loader class>` to the `Template.render` call and it will overwrite any previous loader configuration
    * **Method Two**: When you first instanciate your template object (commonly with `self.template = templating.Template()`) add just your custom loader class as a property of the new template instance::

        self.template.loader = CustomLoader

    Note that is a class and not an instance what you have to use in both methods. The class **must** expect a list of strings (paths) as first and unique argument.
* The mamba-admin application subcommand generates now a ``logs`` directory and logs files are created inside it
* The mamba-admin application subcommand generates now a ``lib`` directory into the ``application`` directory in oreder to place code that doesn't fit the MVC pattern and 3rd party libraries
* The ``@route`` decorator now accepts lists and tuples defining more than one HTTP method where to register the given action
* The :class:`~mamba.enterprise.common.NativeEnum` type has been reimplemented as a ``set``. Implementation provided by Patrick O'Loughlin @paddyoloughlin on GitHub
